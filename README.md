Reference CAD files for NEON integrations

Use the reference files in this repository to design your own NEON integrations!

## Files

`NEON_JAN_frame_reference.step` - A 3d model of the "Just act natural" frame, can be used to understand, where the module should sit relative to the wearers face.

`NEON_Module_reference.step` - A 3d model of the NEON module and 

`NEON_Bare_Metal_Nest_reference.step` - A 3d model of the NEON nest pcb also know as 'bare metal'. The 'Bare Metal' nest pcb comes with a USB-C cable attached. You can desolder and attach your own cable if needed.
